# Greyhill-To-MAX-Adapter-v2

Provides a solder-on PCB to a Greyhill 63R-series encoder. This terminates
with a SPARK MAX connector so that it could be used as an alternative to
a through bore encoder (from REV).

## Disclaimer

This board has not been fabricated and tested. It is published prior to
Kickoff to be compliant with FRC rules regarding fabrication schedule. But
the same rules would prohibit use of a functional prototype on a competition
robot, making it effectively e-waster. So I'll fab this after kickoff and
make updates if necessary.
